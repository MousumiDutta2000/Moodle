Deployment of Learning Management System using Moodle

The goal of the Moodle learning management system is to give teachers, administrators, and students access to one reliable, private, and integrated system that comprises detailed learning environments. It gives us a quick way for the participants to engage with one another and exchange information about their coursework.
The teaching staff also gains a clear awareness of the student's progress; the attendance can be generated routinely; the exam could have been given online, and lessons can also be published on the internet. The administrators receive all the information about the classes or courses, making it easier for him to track every minute detail without hovering everywhere. Students can also benefit since they can attend class from any location, the time constraints on learning can be modified, and they can ask questions to get answers to their questions.
